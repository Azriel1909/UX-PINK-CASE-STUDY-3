The typical user is between the ages of 20 and 35, and most users are college students or adult parents with a professional job.

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p class="des">I started by conducting user interviews, which I then turned into empathy maps to understand the target user and their needs. I found that most of the target users find better opportunities by acquiring mental health information online or attending virtual therapy through video conferencing tools, however, many websites are complex and confusing to navigate, which frustrates users. Even when the search experience for these psychological services is thanks to difficult decisions, the user experience becomes a challenge when there are no accessible tools, defeating the purpose of finding these psychological health opportunities.</p>

          <h3>Pain Points</h3>
          <p class="des"><b>Navigation:</b>Mental health institution website designs often have redundant information, resulting in confusing navigation. </p>
          <p class="des"><b>Interaction:</b> The structure of the websites of mental health institutions makes it difficult to identify the desired sections, which sometimes causes frustration among users.</p>
